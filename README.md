# Budget Tracker

The Budget Tracker application allows users are able to track their withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection. So that their account balance is accurate when traveling. Even when users are not connected to the internet, when the user inputs an expense or deposit they will receive a notification that they have added an expense or deposit. When the user reestablishes an internet connection. Then the deposits or expenses added while they were offline are added to their transaction history and their totals are updated.
